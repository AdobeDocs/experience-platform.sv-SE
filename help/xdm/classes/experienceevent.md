# [!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent]

[!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent]

An Experience Event is a fact record of what occurred, including the point in time and identity of the individual involved. Events can be either explicit (directly observable human actions) or implicit (raised without a direct human action) and are recorded without aggregation or interpretation. [](../home.md#data-behaviors)

[!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent] The values of some of these fields are automatically populated when data is ingested:

![](../images/classes/experienceevent/structure.png)

| Property | Beskrivning |
| --- | --- |
| `_id` | A unique string identifier for the event. This field is used to track the uniqueness of an individual event, prevent duplication of data, and look up that event in downstream services. `_id`[](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)[](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid?view=net-5.0)<br><br> `uri-reference` Afterwards, the concatenated value should be hashed using SHA-256 or another algorithm of your choice.<br><br>**** [](../schema/composition.md#identity) |
| `eventMergeId` | [](../../edge/home.md) This field is automatically populated by the system upon data ingestion. The use of this field outside of the context of a Web SDK implementation is not supported. |
| `eventType` | A string that indicates the type or category for the event. This field can be used if you want to distinguish different event types within the same schema and dataset, such as distinguishing a product view event from an add-to-shopping-cart event for a retail company.<br><br>[](#eventType) This field is an extensible enum, meaning that you can also use your own event type strings to categorize the events you are tracking.<br><br>`eventType` [](#calculated) |
| `producedBy` | A string value that describes the producer or origin of the event. This field can be used to filter out certain event producers if needed for segmentation purposes.<br><br>[](#producedBy) This field is an extensible enum, meaning that you can also use your own strings to represent different event producers. |
| `identityMap` | A map field that contains a set of namespaced identities for the individual that the event applies to. This field is automatically updated by the system as identity data is ingested. [](../../profile/home.md)<br /><br />[](../schema/composition.md#identityMap) |
| `timestamp` | [](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) This timestamp must occur in the past. [](#timestamps) |

## Best practices for event modeling

The following sections cover best practices for designing your event-based Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas in Adobe Experience Platform.

### Timestamps {#timestamps}

`timestamp`**** If your segmentation use cases require the use of timestamps that may occur in the future, these values must be constrained elsewhere in your Experience Event schema.

`timestamp` Other timestamps that are related to the event, such as the start date of the travel reservation, should be captured in separate fields provided by standard or custom field groups.

![](../images/classes/experienceevent/timestamps.png)

By keeping the class-level timestamp separate from other related datetime values in your event schemas, you can implement flexible segmentation use cases while preserving a timestamped account of customer journeys in your experience application.

### Using calculated fields {#calculated}

Certain interactions in your experience applications can result in multiple related events that technically share the same event timestamp, and can therefore be represented as a single event record. `eventType``commerce.productViews``web.webpagedetails.pageViews` In these cases, you can use calculated fields to capture the most important attributes when multiple events are captured in a single hit.

[](../../data-prep/home.md) [](../../data-prep/functions.md) `eventType`

[](../../data-prep/ui/mapping.md#calculated-fields)

If you are streaming data to Platform using a source connection, you can configure the source to utilize calculated fields instead. [](../../sources/home.md)

## Compatible schema field groups {#field-groups}

>[!NOTE]

>The names of several field groups have changed. [](../field-groups/name-updates.md)
