# [!UICONTROL Financial services]

The following entity relationship diagram (ERD) represents a standardized data model for the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) industry. The ERD is intentionally presented in a de-normalized fashion and with consideration for how data is stored in Adobe Experience Platform.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The ERD as described is a recommendation for how you should model your data for this industry use case. To make use of this data model in Platform, you must construct the recommended schemas and their relationships yourself. [](../../ui/resources/schemas.md)[](../../tutorials/relationship-ui.md)

Use the following legend to interpret this ERD:

* [](../composition.md#class)
* ****
* The most important fields for a given entity are highlighted in red.
* All the properties that could be used to identify individual customers are marked as &quot;identity&quot;, with one of these properties marked as a &quot;primary identity&quot;.
* Entity relationships are marked as non-dependent, since cookie-based events often cannot determine the person or individual who did the transaction.
